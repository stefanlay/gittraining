== Fork the example repository on github

In the following exercises you will work with remote repositories.
First you will learn how to work with a repository where only you have
access. Such a repository can easily be created at github. 

In github there are two ways to get a repository.

* Create a new one and push the initial content from a local repository
* Create a copy of an existing repository hosted at github. in github, this is called 'Fork'

As we have already worked with the repositoy at 
https://github.com/laytraining/gittraining-sample.git, we use the second way.

=== Sign up at github

Before you can fork a repository you have to create an account at github.

Open http://www.github.com in a browser. Enter a username, an e-mail adress and a password.
The e-mail address should match the address you used for the git setup; github uses the e-mail
address to identify the author of a commit.

=== Fork the Repository

Once you have signed up you can read about forking by pressing the fork button.

In order to fork a repository you have to look it up in github.

Enter "gittraining-sample" in the search box:

Once you found it, click on the link:

Now you can create your own fork by pressing the 'Fork' button:

You have now created your own copy of the training repository on github.

In the next exercise you will learn how you can link your local clone to the new repository and how you can push to it.
