=== Get Familiar with the Example Project

The example repository contains two projects:

* 'org.eclipse.example.calc' - contains a simple calculator
* 'org.eclipse.example.calc.test' - contains unit tests

Both projects contain launch configurations. Use them to start the calculator
or run the unit tests.

NOTE: For Mac there is a specific launch configuration with the 'Mac' in the
name.

Command Group can be activated to show a Git Workbench Toolbar and/or Menu.

==== History View
To browse the history of the repository, open the History View: On the
repository node in the Git Repositories View click 'Show In > History'
(Some views, e.g. in the Java EE-Perspective, do not have this
shortcut, in this case use 'Team > Show in History'). Best you
arrange the Repositories View and the History View next to each other,
as shown below.
