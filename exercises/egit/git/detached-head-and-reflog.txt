== Detached Head and Reflog

Once you get used to git you appreciate that git does not throw away anything which is added to the repository. 
For example,  if a commit is not reachable from any branch or reference, it is still there in the repository.
There are some tools which help to find it. One powerful tool is the so-called reflog.

In this exercise you create such an unreferenced commit by committing with a detached head. There are other
scenarios where a commit gets lost, e.g. after an amend or a reset.

=== Detach your head
A simple way to create a detached head is to check out a remote tracking branch. This is a common scenario. 
You may want to test the state in the remote repository.

Go to the Git repositories view and checkout origin/master.

Egit warns you that you now have a detached head.

Now you come back from lunch and you do not realize that you have not checked out a branch.
You create a very complicated feature and commit it.

The history view looks like this:

=== "Loose" your commit 

The next morning you come back to your office and you urgently have to fix a bug. Checkout another branch.

The commit you made before is not visible anymore in the history view.

=== Find it again in the reflog

Git has not only kept the commit in the repository, it has even written a log entry that the HEAD had pointed to it.
To find it again, open the Git Reflog view, either with Ctrl+3 and typing reflog or from the Git repositories view, 
Show in -> Git reflog. Now you see a table with all the commits where HEAD pointed to, together with the 
commit message, the date and a description of why the HEAD changed.

When you click on the branch symbol on the upper right corner, you can select a branch. Then you will
 see all the commits where the branch has pointed to.

From the table you can directly check out the commit, or you can open the Git Commit Viewer.
