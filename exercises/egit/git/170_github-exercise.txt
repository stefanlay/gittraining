== GitHub Integration with Eclipse

=== Introduction
GitHub is the world’s largest source code repository with over 2 million Git repositories and 1 million people.  You can use it to share code and collaborate with others on projects.  The Eclipse organization on GitHub mirrors over 240 of the Git repositories available from Eclipse.org.  This training will involve setting up a project to be shared on GitHub, importing a project from GitHub using EGit, and how GitHub can be used to share code snippets with other developers.
