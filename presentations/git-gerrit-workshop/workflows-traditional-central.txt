Central workflow like in Subversion
-----------------------------------

* One central repository
* All developers work on the same branch in central repo (default: master)
* Older releases have release branch
* All developers have right to push to central branch


Workflow

* Always fetch or pull before starting
* Create local feature branch
* Before pushing, fetch and rebase your feature branch
* Push to the central master branch
