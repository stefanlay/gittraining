Workflow with code review
-------------------------

* One main central repository
* either one master branch or feature branches (for larger features)
* a commit is pushed to a review queue
* a commit in the review queue can be fetched by reviewer or by central build
* a reworked commit completely replaces the former versions
* finally, if reviewers are satisfied, the commit is merged into the central branch
* mostly peer review, everbody can review anything

Workflow

* fetch from remote repository
* create local branch on latest state of remote feature branch
* optionally, before pushing, fetch and rebase
* push to the review queue
* wait for reviews
* if rework is necessary, checkout the commit, replace it (with amend) and push to review
* finally the commit is merged
