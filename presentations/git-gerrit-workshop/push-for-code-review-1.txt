Push for Code Review
--------------------

Push to Gerrit is the same like push to Git

* with one Gerrit speciality: +
  [red]+refs/for/+ +
  as the prefix for the target branch name

Compare:

* Push to Git: +
  `git push origin HEAD:master`
* Push to Gerrit: +
  `git push origin HEAD:`[red]+refs/for/+`master`
