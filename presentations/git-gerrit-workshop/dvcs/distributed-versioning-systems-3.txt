Advantages of distributed version control systems
-------------------------------------------------
Distributed means no central repository

* each developer has a complete, local repository
* easy offline usage
* easy to branch a project

No reasons anymore not to commit

* in CVCS your commit affects others
* might break the build

DVCS allows larger refactoring and developments without affecting the main developer branch
