Single user workflow
--------------------

* One central repository, several local repositories, same user
* Central repository to synchronize changes between computers and for backup
* No parallel changes
* Local branches have counterparts on the central repo

Workflow

* Always pull before starting to work -> no conflicts because no parallel work
* Default push strategy: Push local branches to remote counterparts
